# NetworkPolicy for Polecat agent pods.
# Restricts egress to essential services only:
# - DNS for name resolution
# - HTTPS for API calls (Claude API, GitHub API)
# - SSH for git operations
#
# Note: This policy is applied to pods created by the operator when they have
# the 'gastown.io/polecat' label. The operator adds this label automatically.
